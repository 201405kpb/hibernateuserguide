    Use of the build-in integration for [JCache](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) requires that the `hibernate-jcache` module jar (and all of its dependencies) are on the classpath.
    In addition a JCache implementation needs to be added as well.
    A list of compatible implementations can be found [on the JCP website](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/implementations/jsr107/index.html).
    An alternative source of compatible implementations can be found through [the JSR-107 test zoo](https://github.com/cruftex/jsr107-test-zoo).
