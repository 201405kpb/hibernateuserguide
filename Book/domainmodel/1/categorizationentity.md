# 实体类型

    Entities, by nature of their unique identifier, exist independently of other objects whereas values do not.
    Entities are domain model classes which correlate to rows in a database table, using a unique identifier.
    Because of the requirement for a unique identifier, entities exist independently and define their own lifecycle.
    The `Contact` class itself would be an example of an entity.

    

    Mapping entities is discussed in detail in [Entity](#entity).
