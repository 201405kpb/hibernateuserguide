    #### 24.1.21. `@Entity`

    <div class="paragraph">

    The [`@Entity`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Entity.html) annotation is used to specify that the currently annotate class represents an entity type.
    Unlike basic and embeddable types, entity types have an identity and their state is managed by the underlying Persistence Context.
