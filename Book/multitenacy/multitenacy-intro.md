 ### 19.1. What is multitenancy?

    <div class="paragraph">

    The term multitenancy, in general, is applied to software development to indicate an architecture in which a single running instance of an application simultaneously serves multiple clients (tenants).
    This is highly common in SaaS solutions.
    Isolating information (data, customizations, etc.) pertaining to the various tenants is a particular challenge in these systems.
    This includes the data owned by each tenant stored in the database.
    It is this last piece, sometimes called multitenant data, on which we will focus.
