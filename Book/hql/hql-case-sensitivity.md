### 15.5. Case Sensitivity

    <div class="paragraph">

    With the exception of names of Java classes and properties, queries are case-insensitive.
    So `SeLeCT` is the same as `sELEct` is the same as `SELECT`, but `org.hibernate.eg.FOO` and `org.hibernate.eg.Foo` are different, as are `foo.barSet` and `foo.BARSET`.
