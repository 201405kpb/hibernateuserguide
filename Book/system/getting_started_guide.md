>While having a strong background in SQL is not required to use Hibernate, it certainly helps a lot because it all boils down to SQL statements.
Probably even more important is an understanding of data modeling principles.
You might want to consider these resources as a good starting point:

>*   [Data Modeling Wikipedia definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling)

>*   [Data Modeling 101](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html)

>Understanding the basics of transactions and design patterns such as _Unit of Work_ [PoEAA](#PoEAA) or _Application Transaction_ are important as well.
These topics will be discussed in the documentation, but a prior understanding will certainly help.
