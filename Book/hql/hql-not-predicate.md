 ### 15.48. NOT predicate operator

    <div class="paragraph">

    The `NOT` operator is used to negate the predicate that follows it.
    If that following predicate is true, the NOT resolves to false.

    <table>
    <tr>
    <td class="icon">

    </td>
    <td class="content">
    <div class="paragraph">

    If the predicate is true, NOT resolves to false. If the predicate is unknown (e.g. `NULL`), the NOT resolves to unknown as well.
