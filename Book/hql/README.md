 ## 15. HQL and JPQL

    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph">

    The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) are both object model focused query languages similar in nature to SQL.
    JPQL is a heavily-inspired-by subset of HQL.
    A JPQL query is always a valid HQL query, the reverse is not true however.

    <div class="paragraph">

    Both HQL and JPQL are non-type-safe ways to perform query operations.
    Criteria queries offer a type-safe approach to querying.  See [Criteria](#criteria) for more information.
