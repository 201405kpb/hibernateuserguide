    ### 15.49. AND predicate operator

    <div class="paragraph">

    The `AND` operator is used to combine 2 predicate expressions.
    The result of the AND expression is true if and only if both predicates resolve to true.
    If either predicates resolves to unknown, the AND expression resolves to unknown as well. Otherwise, the result is false.
