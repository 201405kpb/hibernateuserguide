    ### 15.50. OR predicate operator

    <div class="paragraph">

    The `OR` operator is used to combine 2 predicate expressions.
    The result of the OR expression is true if one predicate resolves to true.
    If both predicates resolve to unknown, the OR expression resolves to unknown.
    Otherwise, the result is false.
