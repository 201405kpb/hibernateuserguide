    ### 22.1. Portability Basics

    <div class="paragraph">

    One of the selling points of Hibernate (and really Object/Relational Mapping as a whole) is the notion of database portability.
    This could mean an internal IT user migrating from one database vendor to another, or it could mean a framework or deployable application consuming Hibernate to simultaneously target multiple database products by their users.
    Regardless of the exact scenario, the basic idea is that you want Hibernate to help you run against any number of databases without changes to your code, and ideally without any changes to the mapping metadata.
